# SampleNativeLibrary
RhinoCommon cross-platform native library sample

##Overview
This sample demonstrates how to create a RhinoCommon plug-in that utilizes functions from a native C++ library. 

##Building Sample

###Windows
To build the sample on Windows, you are going to need:

* Rhino 6 for Windows (WIP, http://discourse.mcneel.com/)
* Microsoft Visual C# 2013
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2013

To build both the Rhino plug-in and the native library, load the **SampleNativeLibrary.sln** solution in Visual Studio 2013. Then, click **Build -> Build Solution**. Note, you might want to unload the **SampleRhino.Mac** project before building. You can do this by right-clicking on the project and clicking **Unload project**.

###Mac
To build the sample on OS X, you are going to need:

* Rhino 5 for Mac (5.1)
* Xamarin Studio 5.9
* Apple Xcode 6.4

Building the Rhino plug-in the native library are separate processes.

To build the Rhino plug-in, load the **SampleNativeLibrary.sln** solution in Xamarin Studio. Then, click **Build -> Build All**" Note, you may want to unload both the **SampleLibrary** and **SampleRhino.Win** projects before building. You can do this by right-clicking on each project and clicking **Unload**.

To build the native library, load the **SampleLibrary.xcodeproj** into Xcode. Then click **Product -> Build**. Note, you will need to copy the output library, **libSampleLibrary.dylib**, to the Rhino plug-in output folder. Also, copy **SampleRhino.dll.config**, found in the **SampleLibrary** project folder, to the Rhino plug-in folder. For more information on the config file, see the Mono Project notes found in the Useful Links section below.
